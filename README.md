# duckyScript
Work done through CyberHoos during the Fall 2018 semester. Goal of this project is to develop a rubber ducky script that allows an individual to install x.509 certificates onto a machine. Testing was done via Mac OSx, and later updates will include Windows functionality. Sub folders in this repository document the step-by-step learning process of this project.
